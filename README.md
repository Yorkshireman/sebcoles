Need to install Groupify before setting up Devise login, then:
apply devise to the User model generated by Groupify. See Devise Readme.

Use Devise for Admins instead of Groupify?

For assigning students to groups, and groups to teachers, could use the .update_attributes method as per treehouse video here:
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/rails-models/migrations-and-relationships/relationships

This shows how you can set a Group's :teacher_id to a certain Teacher's :id, or a Student's :group_id to a certain group's :id.


after assigning a Student instance to a student variable, and a Group instance to a group variable:

student.update_attributes(group: group)


I think can also do this in the console:
group.teacher_id = 1
